API Libraries for the ZipRecruiter JobAlerts API

Instructions

Our .Net API was written using Mono and targets the .Net 4.0 runtime.

A compiled DLL and some instructions can be found at dotnet/ZRJobAlertsAPI.zip.

Sample code can be found at dotnet/ZRAPI/ZRAPI/Examples.cs. You can run the examples via the Solution file. This release lacks formal tests save for the Example code.

A Bash build script is provided at dotnet/ZRAPI/build_release. Building the project requires a C# compiler (Xamarin or Microsoft).
Otherwise you can build the DLL via VisualStudio 2010 (and later) or Xamarin Studio
